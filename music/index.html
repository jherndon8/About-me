    <h1> Music </h1>
    <h3>Classical</h3>
    <p> I started taking piano lessons when I was in 1st grade. I also sang in
        my church choir from an age of 5 up until middle school. In 5th grade
        I joined Atlanta Young Singers, and got to travel to places like
        Memphis, New York City, and internationally to Sweden, Finland, Estonia,
        and Latvia. I have also taken AP Music theory my junior year of high
        school, where I learned about 4-part polyphonic part-writing in the
        style of Bach. For my senior project, I started a barbershop quartet,
        and we sang christmas carols at nursing homes. Currently, I am a member
        of Georgia Tech's chamber choir.

    <h3>Concert Band / Jazz</h3>
    <p> In 5th grade I started playing saxophone in the concert band, and from
        there I also played in the jazz ensemble in middle school. 
        In high school I started taking jazz
        piano lessons from the community music center in Decatur. I also played
        saxophone in a jazz combo at the CMC in little 5 points.

    <h3>Rock</h3>
    <p>
        In summer of late middle school and early high school, I went to Chicago
        Joe's Rock and Blues camp, where I played piano, saxophone and even sang
        an Elvis song. In high school, I joined Decatur High School's Rock 'n'
        Roll Revue, where student bands form to play rock songs from the 80s and
        before. My senior year, I joined a rock band called Stratford.

    <h3>Marching Band</h3>
    <p>
        In high school, I played saxophone in Decatur High School's marching
        band. My senior year, I switched from saxophone to marching baritone,
        in hopes that it would help me march drum and bugle corps. Fortunately,
        I got a spot for the 2014 Spirit of Atlanta brass line. Currently I am
        a baritone player in the Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket Marching band, and
        I have been a member of Spirit Of Atlanta's brass line for two summers.
