    <h2>Minesweeper game</h2>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Click a square to dig. If there is a mine under that square, you lose.
            If a number is displayed, that tells you how many mines are next to it
            (including diagonals).
        </li>
        <li>
            Note: do not worry about the first move. The mines are set after the
            first dig so you should always have a nice starting point.
        </li>
        <li>
            Right-click a square to mark it as a mine. You do not have to mark every
            mine to win; you only need to dig all the non-mines. Right-clicking
            before you dig your first square is disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
            If there is a number with the correct number of mines marked around it,
            double-click the number to dig on all the squares that are not marked
            around it (This has the same functionality as right+left clicking in the
            original game).
        </li>
    </ul>
